# Sacramento, CA Meets Music and Code

Check out the [Live Demo](https://lshig.github.io/sacramento-music)!

A way for me to express my love for Sacramento, CA, music, and code. This is also a place for me to play with Atom, GitHub Pages, Babel, ES2015, JSX, React, Webpack, Highcharts, Bower, Node.js, npm, Materialize, Font Awesome, and SASS.

## Basics

- Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [Bower](https://bower.io/)
- Install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) configured to an editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Clone or fork the repository `https://github.com/lshig/sacramento-music.git`
- In the terminal: `cd sacramento-music; npm start`
- Build `npm run build:dev` for debugging
- Build `npm run build:prod` for production-ish
- Option 1: View by opening `index.html` in a web browser
- Option 2: `npm run server` and open `http://localhost:8080/`

## TODO
- add events to demonstrate React + Redux
- make page more accessible
- build better web scrapper, AUTOMATION


Thanks for stopping by to see one of the things I like to experiment on!

Cheers,<br>
